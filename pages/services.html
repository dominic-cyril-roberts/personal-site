        <h4>Technical Consulting</h4>
        <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wMmhAa2IKXxIL-5xzvmx_RMCo9SkHUUG80-aqPI-_Sg/edit#"> It is notoriously not hard to code good</a>. If you'd like me to weigh in on a technical problem you have I will give you an hour of my time for $100 and we can come up with a plan to solve that problem (either during that meeting or moving forward). Corporations pay me 6 figures a year for this service but they're frustrating as hell to work with because the people with the problems are generally so far removed from the development team. So I will do it for a very small fraction of the price if you, the customer, engage me directly.</p>

        <h4>Contract Web Development</h4>
        <p>If you just need a website made or revamped I do that too. I also do it for absurdly cheap at the moment because I am currently building out my freelance portfolio. This site is the only thing I've worked on that's deployed at present, but below is a list of services I offer in this space:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><h4>Content Specification</h4>
                <p>This is the one thing that actually matters but which so many people in this industry overlook for some reason. I start by working with you to identify what a sane content offering for your website looks like given your specific business needs; we theme and design on top of that content.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h4>Development</h4>
                <p>Once we nail down the content (or if you already have a website whose content you are happy with but which you want updated) I will write the actual code and handle deploying that site for you. I will do it quickly because this is not actually a difficult job unless you use arbitrarily bad tools.</p>
