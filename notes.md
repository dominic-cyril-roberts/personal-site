        - I have credible thoughts about things that haven't been vetted by Phds' and are therefore broadly dismissed by people who don't care to think from first principles. I am not unique in this. It is frustrating to talk about these thoughts in person because people often engage novel ideas they disagree with from a defensive posture that presupposes the idea is wrong BECAUSE they don't already agree with it. So I write those thoughts down.

            - technical consulting
                - I am far above average at getting things done using code. If you'd like me to weigh in on a technical problem you have I will give you an hour of my time for $100 and we can come up with a plan to solve that problem (either during that meeting or moving forward). Corporations pay my 6 figures a year for this service but they're frustrating as hell to work with because the people with the problems are generally so far removed from the development team.  
            - contract web development
                - If you just need a website made or revamped I do that too. I also do it for absurdly cheap because I am currently building out my freelance portfolio. This site is the only thing I've worked on that's deployed at present, but below is a list of services I offer in this space:
                    - Content
                        - This is the thing that actually matters but which so many people in this industry overlook for some reason. I start by working with you to identify what a sane content offering for your website looks like given your specific business needs; we theme and design on top of that content.
                    - Web Development
                        - Once we nail down the content (or if you already have a website whose content you are happy with but which you want updated) I will write the actual code and handle deploying that site for you. I will do it quickly because this is not actually a difficult job unless you use arbitrarily bad tools.
                    - Payment Processing
                        - Right now I have done this using Paypal for my own site. I am interested in using Stripe , which is supposed to be better for large volume/big ticket transactions. If there is another payment processor (e.g Square) you are interested in using or that makes sense then I will learn that API and develop a solution using it. The last corporate gig I had hired about 9 developers to do this job and committed about a year to get the MVP out (that is like, a million dollars for that company). I will do it for 4 figures, because it is not a hard problem.
