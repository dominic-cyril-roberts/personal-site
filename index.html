        <h2>Why Hello There!</h2>
        <p>
            I'm Nic, and this is a site I made to tell you that! I am a software engineer and burgenoning entrepeneur with 5 years of industry experience working for Fortune 500 companies. I grew up with a genius for a dad, and an incredible listener for a mom, and they taught me everything they know; they did it so well that I think and listen better than they do! 
        </p>
        <p>
            They are also West Indians who were smart enough to finish their education in the USA, where they had me! It also means my brothers and I were disciplined the way they do it in the Third World (once removed). The result of that is that I was finished baking pretty young, but I learned that if you talk out loud sometimes you get threatened or beat! So I've spent most of my adult life with clinical grade depression.
        </p>
        <p>
            But good news! I recently realized the world isn't patronizing me when they say "my god you're smart". I recently realized the reason so many of my questions frustrate people is because they are not even remotely close to answering them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hello World! It's me Nic! I ask hard questions, and I don't stop thinking until I have answers in every language I speak.
