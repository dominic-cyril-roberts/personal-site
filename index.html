        <h2>Why Hello There!</h2>
        <p>
            I'm Nic, and this is a site I made to tell you that. I am a software engineer and burgenoning entrepeneur with 5 years of industry experience working for Fortune 500 companies. I grew up with a genius for a dad, and an incredible listener for a mom, and they taught me everything they know and then some! 
        </p>
        <p>
            My parents are West Indians who were smart enough to get sent to finish their education in the USA, where they had my brothers and me. That means we were disciplined the way they do it in the Third World (once removed). The result of that is: I was finished baking pretty young (my parents did a near perfect job for about 8 years and then I became a heavily isolated latchkey kid; raised by tv). I was the youngest, so I got real quiet because I learned that if you talk out loud sometimes you get threatened or beat! So I've spent most of my adult life with clinical grade depression (because of the silence).
        </p>
        <p>
            But good news! I recently realized the world isn't patronizing me when they say "my god you're smart". I recently realized the reason so many of my questions frustrate people is because they are not even remotely close to answering them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hello World! It's me Nic! I ask hard questions, and I don't stop thinking until I have answers in every language I speak.
