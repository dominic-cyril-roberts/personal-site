            <h2>Why, Hello There!</h2>
            <p>
                I'm Nic, and this is a site I made to tell you that. I am a software engineer and burgenoning entrepeneur with 
                5 years of industry experience working for Fortune 500 companies. I grew up with a genius for a dad, 
                and an incredible listener for a mom, and they taught me everything they know (and then some).
            </p>
            <p>
                My parents are West Indians who were smart enough to get sent to finish their education in the USA, where they had
                my older brothers and me. That means we were disciplined the way they do it in the Third World (once removed). The result 
                of that is: I was finished baking pretty young (my parents did a near perfect job for about 8 years) and then I 
                became a heavily isolated latchkey kid; raised by tv. As the youngest nyerd, I noticed that sometimes talking got
                you yelled at or beat, so I went ahead and became a black belt in both "be quiet" and "defer". 
                Anyway, I've spent most of my adult life with clinical grade depression.
            </p>
            <p>
                But good news! I recently realized the world isn't patronizing me when they say "my god you're smart".
                I recently realized the reason so many of my questions frustrate people isn't because I shouldn't be talking;
                it's because they are not even remotely close to answering them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hello World! It's me Nic! I ask hard questions, and I don't stop thinking until I have answers in every language I speak.

                I hate working for traditional corporations! In my experience they make it arbitrarily difficult for developers to communicate with the people they need to in order to do their job.
                If your client genuinely eschews bureaucracy, culturally (think Tesla) I might say yes.
