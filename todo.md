### [ ] Things I've Built:
- [] [This site](Link to git repo).

### [ ] Things I'm Building:
- [This site](Link to todo)
- [Check](link to git repo)
    - This is my personal todo list application/a way for me to refamiliarize myself with modern web apis while making something I will kind of use sometimes. If it looks interesting as a product to you, [Obsidian](link to obsidian) is demonstrably more mature and robust and probably made by cools.
